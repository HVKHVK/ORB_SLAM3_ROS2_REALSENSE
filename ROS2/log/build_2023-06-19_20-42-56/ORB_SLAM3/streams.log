[0.366s]   because target "Mono" links to some libraries for which the linker must
[0.366s]   search:
[0.366s] 
[0.366s]     -lboost_system
[0.366s] 
[0.366s]   and other libraries with known full path:

[0.366s]   CMake is adding directories in the second list to the linker search path in
[0.366s]   case they are needed to find libraries from the first list (for backwards
[0.366s]   compatibility with CMake 2.4).  Set policy CMP0003 to OLD or NEW to enable
[0.366s]   or disable this behavior explicitly.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0003" for
[0.366s]   more information.
[0.366s] This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
